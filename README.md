# Introduction
A simple error reporting tool. Learning Go and angular

## Installation
Prerequisites: Golang and Postgres, ngrok or some other tunneling software for local dev
1. Clone the Project and setup your local db
2. Go to project root and run `go install` followed by `$GOPATH/bin/errgular`. Of course this assumes that the `$GOPATH` is set and this is cloned into your Go Workspace

## TODO
* Set up a file to contain all the custom errors to throw
* Dabble with go's test suite
* Read up on go spew?
* Get the angular part up
